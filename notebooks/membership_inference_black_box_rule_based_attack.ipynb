    "#### Explanation of the outcome:\n",
    "##### Attacker Advantage:\n",
    "The attacker advantageis a score that relies on comparing the model output on member and non-member data points. The model outputs are probability values over all classes, and they are often different on member and non-member data points. Usually, the model is more confident on member data points, because it has seen them during training. When trying to find a threshold value to tell apart member and non-member samples by their different model outputs, the attacker has interest in finding the best ratio between false positives “fpr” (non-members that are classified as members) and true positives “tpr” (members that are correctly identifies as members). \n",
    "\n",
    "This best ratio is calculated as the max(tpr-fpr) over all threshold values and represents the attacker advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Slicing: Incorrectly classified:\n",
    "It is normal that the attacker is more successful to deduce membership on incorrectly classified samples than on correctly classified ones. This results from the fact, that model predictions are often better on training than on test data points, whereby your attack model might learn to predict incorrectly classified samples as non-members. If your model overfits the training data, this assumption might hold true often enough to make the attack seem more successful on this slice. If you wish to reduce that, pay attention to reducing your model’s overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Slicing: Specific classes more vulnerable: \n",
    "It seems that the membership inference attack is more successful on your class X than on the other classes. Research has shown that the class distribution (and also the distribution of data points within one class) are factors that influence the vulnerability of a class for membership inference attacks [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, small classes (belonging to minority groups) can be more prone to membership inference attacks [6]. One reason for this could be, that there is less data for that class, and therefore, the model overfits within this class. It might make sense to look into the vulnerable classes of your model again, and maybe add more data to them, use private synthetic data, or introduce privacy methods like Differential Privacy [6]. Attention, the use of Differential Privacy could have a negative influence on the performance of your model for the minority classes.\n",

    "Finally, we can perform our Membership Inference Attack Analysis. Therefore, we input the target model, the data that should be analysed, the membership labels (i.e. the labels which correctly describe if a data point is a member of the training dataset or not) and the splicing specification into the `analyse()` method. As a result, we get for each slice the indices of the corresponding data points, a human-readable description of the slice and the advantage score of the Membership Inference Attack (for more details about the advantage score, please read the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01604)."

    "#### Explanation of the outcome:\n",
    "##### Attacker Advantage:\n",
    "The attacker advantageis a score that relies on comparing the model output on member and non-member data points. The model outputs are probability values over all classes, and they are often different on member and non-member data points. Usually, the model is more confident on member data points, because it has seen them during training. When trying to find a threshold value to tell apart member and non-member samples by their different model outputs, the attacker has interest in finding the best ratio between false positives “fpr” (non-members that are classified as members) and true positives “tpr” (members that are correctly identifies as members). \n",
    "\n",
    "This best ratio is calculated as the max(tpr-fpr) over all threshold values and represents the attacker advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Slicing: Incorrectly classified:\n",
    "It is normal that the attacker is more successful to deduce membership on incorrectly classified samples than on correctly classified ones. This results from the fact, that model predictions are often better on training than on test data points, whereby your attack model might learn to predict incorrectly classified samples as non-members. If your model overfits the training data, this assumption might hold true often enough to make the attack seem more successful on this slice. If you wish to reduce that, pay attention to reducing your model’s overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Slicing: Specific classes more vulnerable: \n",
    "It seems that the membership inference attack is more successful on your class X than on the other classes. Research has shown that the class distribution (and also the distribution of data points within one class) are factors that influence the vulnerability of a class for membership inference attacks [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, small classes (belonging to minority groups) can be more prone to membership inference attacks [6]. One reason for this could be, that there is less data for that class, and therefore, the model overfits within this class. It might make sense to look into the vulnerable classes of your model again, and maybe add more data to them, use private synthetic data, or introduce privacy methods like Differential Privacy [6]. Attention, the use of Differential Privacy could have a negative influence on the performance of your model for the minority classes.\n",
